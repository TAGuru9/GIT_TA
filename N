As we prepare for the upcoming year, I am sharing the 2026 Test Automation Roadmap for your review, approval, and strategic alignment. This roadmap outlines our direction for strengthening automation, improving quality, optimizing test execution, and driving measurable value across our enterprise programs.

The roadmap covers four key focus areas across 2026:

1. Framework Stabilization & Foundation (Q1)

Modernizing our automation framework, improving locator stability, and establishing coding standards, governance, and CI/CD integration.

2. Automation Expansion & Speed Optimization (Q2)

Increasing automation coverage, introducing parallel execution, and reducing regression execution time to accelerate delivery.

3. AI-Enhanced & Non-Functional Automation (Q3)

AI-based locator healing, predictive test selection, performance and accessibility validation, and enhanced quality dashboards.

4. Optimization, ROI Delivery & 2027 Planning (Q4)

Achieving 85–90% regression automation, generating $1M+ projected savings, enhancing test data automation, and preparing the 2027 strategy.
